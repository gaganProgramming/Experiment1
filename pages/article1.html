        <h1>How to Prepare Idli & Dosa Batter</h1>

        <p>At <strong>Battermami</strong>, we take pride in crafting authentic, fresh, and ready-to-use batters for idlis and dosas. Our batter preparation process ensures that you enjoy the best flavors and textures every time. Hereâ€™s how we prepare our signature batter for your perfect meals:</p>

        <h2>The Preparation Process</h2>
        <p>We follow a traditional method to prepare our idli-dosa batter, which has been perfected over generations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Soaking - We soak high-quality rice and urad dal (black gram) separately for 6-8 hours to ensure softness.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Grinding - After soaking, the ingredients are finely ground to a smooth texture using traditional wet grinders. The grinding process is crucial to get the fluffy texture of idlis and crispy dosas.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Fermentation - The ground batter is allowed to ferment naturally for 8-12 hours, giving it the perfect tangy flavor and airy texture. Fermentation ensures that the batter is rich in probiotics, enhancing the nutritional value.</li>
            <li><strong>Step 4:</strong> Ready to use - Once fermented, the batter is portioned and packed fresh, ready to be used in your kitchen. We ensure no preservatives are added, keeping the batter as natural and healthy as possible.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3>Instructions for Using the Batter</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>For Idlis:</strong> Grease your idli molds lightly with oil. Pour the batter into each mold and steam cook for 10-12 minutes until the idlis are soft and fluffy.</li>
                <li><strong>For Dosas:</strong> Heat a non-stick pan or dosa tawa. Spread a ladle full of batter evenly on the hot surface in a circular motion. Drizzle some oil or ghee around the edges and cook until the dosa turns golden brown and crispy. Flip to cook the other side if desired.</li>
                <li>Store the remaining batter in the refrigerator for up to 4-5 days. Make sure to stir it before each use.</li>
            </ol>
